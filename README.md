Dataset- Data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone

Files-
  CodeBook.md - a code book that describes the variables, the data and any transformations or work performed                 to clean up the data
  
  run_analysis.R- R script that performs the following actions- 
                  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
                  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
                  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
                  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
                  5. From the data set in step4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the                            average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
                  
 FinalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
